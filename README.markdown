Movie Reviews (Joomla Module)
=============================
This Joomla module pulls in movie reviews for a given movie or it will use
the page title to determine the movie. Not all movies will have reviews and
in such a case the module will state it can't find any.

Install
-------
The easiest way is to download the zip file and install using Joomla's
install process.

You can also manually install by grabbing the source and putting it in:
`sitedir/modules/mod_rt_reviews/[HERE]`

Requirements
------------
This module gets it data from the [Rotten Tomatoes
API](http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/) and you will need an
API key from them in order to use it.

Tested with [Joomla](http://www.joomla.org) version 1.5 and 1.6.
